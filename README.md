# Agents External Stubs Frontend

This microservice is part of Agent Services local testing framework,
providing necessary UI stubs complementing API stubs
in [agents-external-stubs](https://github.com/hmrc/agents-external-stubs).

This app SHOULD NOT be run on QA nor Production environment.

## How requests to the stubbed UIs are handled?

To handle requests aimed at stubbed frontend microservices we provide necessary TCP proxies:

- listening on 9025 for company-auth-frontend requests

You can switch this behaviour off by setting `proxies.start` config property to `false`.

## Data Model

Every stubbed user and other data live in some test sandbox (planet).
You have to declare existing or a new planet whenever you sign-in. Each authenticated session has planetId information.
Stubbed and custom UIs will consider only users and data assigned to the current planet. Other apps may contain data
from multiple planets and can clash, so avoid the same names for your users with concurrent planets or tidy up data on
these regularly.

User authentication expires after 15 minutes and so does the bearer token.
All users and other data on each planet are removed after 12h unless marked as permanent.

## Doorway

You can use the doorway to kickstart a service-specific journey. Take a look at `/agents-external-stubs/asa-doorway` to
see the available journeys. Each journey creates a new planet populated with the users or features required for that
journey.

## Authentication

The external stubs frontend provides a stubbed authentication service. You can use it to sign in as a stubbed user and
provides authentication for other services. If you enter the details of an unknown user the stubs service will direct to
the new user creation page.

### Gotchas

The default sign-in journey uses the "Government Gateway" provider type. Some services do not accept auth tokens
generated for that type and require refreshing the session (i.e. sign in, sign out) to generate the correct token.

## Stubbed UIs

See [stubbed UIs](docs/stubbed-ui.md)

## Running the tests

    sbt test it/test

## Running the tests with coverage

    sbt clean coverage test it/test coverageReport

## Running the app locally

    sbt run

## Running the app and associated backend service via Service Manager

    sm2 --start AGENTS_EXTERNAL_STUBS_FRONTEND
    sm2 --start AGENTS_EXTERNAL_STUBS

It should then be listening on ports 9099 and 9009. You could then start using the service at the quick start hub:

    http://localhost:9099/agents-external-stubs/quick-start-hub
